# Early detection of chronic kidney disease 
##### Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) is a global health issue with a rising prevalence and significant public health implications. CKD progresses silently until advanced stages, when interventions become less effective and complications arise. Early detection of CKD is critical for implementing timely interventions that can slow or stop the progression of the disease, mitigate associated complications, and improve patient outcomes.
##### CKD has a significant burden, contributing to increased morbidity, mortality, and healthcare costs. Identifying individuals at risk or in the early stages of CKD allows for the implementation of preventive measures, lifestyle changes, and targeted therapeutic interventions. This overview discusses the significance of early detection in the context of CKD, highlighting key challenges and emerging strategies to improve our ability to identify and manage this condition in its early stages.
##### DATA COllECTION:Data Set is collected from UCI Machine learning which consists of data.
##### DATA ClEANING AND TRANSFORMATION:These steps contribute significantly to the reliability and accuracy of subsequent analyses and modeling efforts
##### DATA VISUAlIZATION: It is a critical component in the data analysis process, providing a means to communicate insights effectively and make data-driven decisions.
##### FEATURE SCAlING:Feature scaling is a preprocessing step in machine learning that involves standardizing or normalizing the numerical features of a dataset.
##### lOGISTIC REGRESSION:logistic Regression is a statistical method used for binary classification problems, where the goal is to predict the probability of an instance belonging to a particular class.
